# 100DaysOfCode
A completion of projects loosely following Angela Yu's Course: Python, 100 Days of Code.

Method for using this course:

    Watch "What We Will Make At The End of Day (x)" video for (x) day.

    I try to build my own version of the project, careful to implement whatever the day's "tool" is (i.e. for loops, while loops, dictionaries, etc.).

    For any code I am able to complete on my own, I build the project, and try to add more features.

    For any code I am unable to complete on my own, I first look up documentation for whatever I am struggling on, and then I watch the remaining videos.


Complexity:

    The projects are listed out in order of days, and their general complexity is:

    Day 1 - 14 == Basic (Conditionals, Loops, Variable Declarations with scope consideration, functions, classes, methods, data types, etc.)

    Day 15 - 40 == Intermediate/Hard (OOP, Files/Directories, Errors and Exceptions, Sending Emails, API Endpoints, Authentication, etc)

    Day 40 - 78 == Intermediate/Hard (Web Development, Web Scraping, Databases, etc.)

    Day 78 - 100 == Personal Project (TBD)
